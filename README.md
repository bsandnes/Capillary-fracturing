# Capillary Fracturing – Image Analysis and Example Data

This repository contains the analysis scripts and example image data associated with the **capillary fracturing** experiments performed in a Hele–Shaw cell with wet granular media. The scripts process raw images to extract fracture patterns, corrected backgrounds, and skeletonised networks.

Only **lightweight example data** is included.  
The full experimental dataset is large and stored locally (not part of this repository).
