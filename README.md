# Capillary Fracturing – Analysis and Example Data

This repository contains Python/Matlab scripts and a small example dataset for analysing capillary fracturing experiments in wet granular materials. The example images allow testing of preprocessing and pattern-extraction workflows without needing the full dataset.

## Structure

- `Analysis/scripts/` — Python analysis scripts  
- `data/example-data/` — Small test dataset (0.01 ml/min experiment)  
- `data/all data/` — Full dataset (excluded via .gitignore)
